    "shortDesc": "Meschain takes the whole texting experience from central level to blockchain, using modern Web Standards for making a more private internet.",
    "longDesc": "In this project I have used the latest of web tech to create and maintain a blockchain in the user's browser and at the same time using peer-to-peer connection startegy to connect and run consenusus across different nodes on the network without relying on a central server. Everything happens on a seperate thread that runs the mining algorithm on the same thread without hindering user experince on the app. Once messages are sent all the nodes competes to add that node to the blockchain, once this is done the new node is published and the reciever displays the latest message from the blockchain.",
    "problem": "Almost all of existing IMs use a centralized service which makes it diffcult on user's privacy and infact there is no way of knowing how they service provider is using the data collected from these IM.",
